2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.540 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_blue_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.543 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_blue_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.585 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_green_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.681 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_red_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.686 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_red_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.687 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_green_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.689 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_green_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.690 ns between H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/cur_x_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and H_D/u_hdmi_data_gen/O_green_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
